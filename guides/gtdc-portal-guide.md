### Example: Multiple Dataset Options

**Query:** "Give me the data on Japan's government debt for 2023."

When multiple datasets are available, the agent will ask for clarification:

**Agent Response:**
"There are two relevant datasets available for Japan's government debt in 2023:

- Government debt as a percent of GDP and in domestic currency (WEO)
- Detailed portfolio investment in government debt securities (BOP)

Please specify your preference. If unsure, the World Economic Outlook (WEO) dataset is recommended for a general
overview."

**User Selection:** "Detailed portfolio investment in government debt securities (BOP)"

**Agent Follow-up:**
"To provide detailed data on Japan's portfolio investment in government debt securities for 2023, please specify the
counterpart country or countries (where Japan holds these investment positions). For example: United States, Germany,
China, or all available countries."
