# StatGPT Solution Overview

**StatGPT** is an AI-driven Talk-To-Your-Data platform that enables users to interact with official statistics data
using natural language. By leveraging large language models (LLMs) and integrating with various data sources, StatGPT
provides insights, analysis, and visualizations based on conversational queries.

## üéØ Purpose

## üöÄ Key Features in Detail

### Natural Language Querying

StatGPT enables users to interact with official statistics data using natural language. Users can ask questions in plain
English (or other supported languages), and the system will interpret the query, retrieve relevant data, and generate a
response.

Data Query tool is responsible for translating user questions into data queries. It leverages the structure and
semantics of SDMX metadata to construct accurate queries that can be executed against the underlying data sources. Input
of the tool includes user question and context about available datasets and their structures. The output is a valid SDMX
query that can be executed to retrieve the requested data OR information about the ambiguity that needs to be resolved
by the user.

Data Query tool uses:

- Semantic and keyword search over indexed datasets and their metadata to identify relevant datasets and indicators.
- SDMX metadata (Dataflows, DSDs, Concepts, Code Lists) to understand the structure and semantics of the data.
- Availability Queries to check if the requested data is available in the identified datasets.
- LLM reasoning to select the appropriate datasets and dimension values based on the user query.

### Wide Indicator Search

**Goal**: Provide comprehensive coverage of relevant datasets rather than just the fastest single result.

**Approach**: StatGPT combines multiple search strategies:

- Special indexing techniques for broad coverage
- Semantic search for conceptual matching
- Keyword search for exact term matching
- LLM reasoning to identify related indicators

Currently, StatGPT supports both semantic-only and hybrid semantic+fulltext search modes. Both modes utilize same embedding
model: `text-embedding-3-large` by OpenAI. Hybrid mode additionally uses ElasticSearch for fulltext search.

### Data Accuracy & Hallucination Prevention

**Strategy**: StatGPT ensures data accuracy through multiple mechanisms:

**1. Query-Based Architecture**

- All data operations use SDMX queries executed against actual databases
- Frontend independently verifies queries and results

**2. Contextual Grounding**

When query results are manageable in size, they're provided to the agent with:

- Tabular data representation in Markdown
- Complete dimension, measure, and attribute information
- Both IDs and human-readable names for coded values
- Dataset reference information

**3. Strict Agent Instructions**

The AI agent is explicitly instructed to:

- ‚úÖ Always cite dataset sources
- ‚úÖ Use provided data exactly as-is
- ‚úÖ Preserve data precision without rounding
- ‚úÖ Respond "I don't know" when data is insufficient
- ‚ùå Never interpret beyond provided data
- ‚ùå Never aggregate without explicit instruction
- ‚ùå Never fabricate missing values

### Glossary of Terms Support

**Purpose**: Ensure consistent use of official statistical terminology.

**Implementation**:

- Glossaries are provided in tabular format
- Integrated as tools available to the AI agent
- Support for domain-specific terminology

**Required Glossary Structure**:

| Column         | Description                       | Required   |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|------------|
| **Term**       | The term or phrase to be defined  | ‚úÖ Yes      |
| **Definition** | Official definition of the term   | ‚úÖ Yes      |
| **Source**     | Reference URL or document         | ‚≠ï Optional |
| **Domain**     | Context (e.g., economics, health) | ‚≠ï Optional |
